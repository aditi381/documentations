# Abstract

Last year, our office Christmas celebration hit a snag: the Secret Santa game wasn't as merry as anticipated. The culprit? Confusion reigned supreme as participants struggled to determine their gift recipients due to the haphazard distribution of chits containing names. In response, Rashmi Ma'am rallied the troops, tasking us with finding a solution. After much deliberation, we settled on crafting a dedicated website to manage Secret Santa exchanges. This document details the genesis of this endeavor, the team involved, and the objectives and features of the website.

# Introduction

Welcome to our Secret Santa Management System! This platform was born out of a need to streamline the organization of Secret Santa events within our workplace. With this website, users can effortlessly register, generate QR codes for gift assignments, manage participant lists, and review past exchanges. Powered by a blend of modern technologies, it's designed to simplify the process and enhance the holiday spirit for all involved.

# Identifying the Need

Last year's Christmas celebration shed light on a glaring issue: the lack of clarity surrounding Secret Santa assignments dampened the festive mood. Rashmi Ma'am recognized this challenge and challenged us to find a solution that would inject new life into the tradition and foster greater engagement among participants.

# Implementing the Solution

Under the expert guidance of Karandeep Sir, a team comprising Aman, Aditi, and Irfan set out to bring our vision to life. Leveraging HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Bootstrap, and React.js, we developed a robust Secret Santa Management System. From initial concept to deployment, our process encompassed thorough requirement analysis, meticulous design planning, rigorous development, comprehensive testing, seamless deployment, user training, documentation, and ongoing support.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, our Secret Santa Management System stands as a testament to innovation and collaboration. By automating key tasks and enhancing user experience, we've revitalized the Secret Santa tradition, fostering camaraderie and spreading joy throughout our workplace. Whether you're part of a small team or a large organization, our platform ensures that every participant experiences the magic of the holiday season.
