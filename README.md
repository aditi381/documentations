# Abstract

The challenge of fostering transparency and engagement during the office Christmas celebration arose last year when participants encountered difficulty in determining their Secret Santa due to the anonymous distribution of chits containing names. In response, Rashmi Ma'am tasked the team with finding a solution. After considering various proposals, the decision was made to develop a dedicated website for managing Secret Santa exchanges. Under the guidance of Karandeep Sir, Aman, Aditi, and Irfan were entrusted with implementing this solution.

The website aims to streamline the Secret Santa experience by facilitating registration, assigning Secret Santas anonymously, and revealing assignments on a specified date to maintain surprise. Key features include ensuring the anonymity of assignments, enabling communication through anonymous messages, sending automated email reminders, and providing a platform for feedback.

Through technology-driven solutions, the objective is to enhance transparency, engagement, and holiday spirit among employees during the Secret Santa game. This approach seeks to address the challenges faced during the previous year's celebration and elevate the overall experience for participants.

# Introduction
Welcome to our Secret Santa Management System, a web-based application designed to streamline the process of organizing Secret Santa events within your organization. This system provides a user-friendly interface for users to register, manage employee lists, generate QR codes for Secret Santa assignments, and track Secret Santa records.

The Secret Santa tradition brings joy and excitement to workplaces during the holiday season, fostering camaraderie and team spirit. However, coordinating Secret Santa exchanges manually can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Our system aims to simplify this process by leveraging modern web technologies to automate key tasks and enhance user experience.

With our application, new users can easily register and existing users can log in to access the system's features. Once authenticated, users are greeted with a home page offering three main options: generating QR codes for Secret Santa assignments, managing the employee list, and viewing Secret Santa records.

The QR code generation feature allows administrators to effortlessly assign Secret Santas to employees by generating unique QR codes for each participant. Employees can then scan these codes, revealing their Secret Santa assignments and providing a seamless experience for everyone involved.

Additionally, the system facilitates the management of the employee list, enabling administrators to add, delete, and update employee details as needed. This ensures that the participant roster remains up-to-date and accurate throughout the process.

Furthermore, users can easily view Secret Santa records, including each employee's assigned Secret Santa and relevant contact information. Automated email notifications are sent out to participants on December 26th, enhancing the excitement and mystery of the Secret Santa tradition.

Powered by a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, Bootstrap, and React.js, our Secret Santa Management System offers a robust and efficient solution for organizing memorable and enjoyable Secret Santa exchanges. Whether you're a small team or a large organization, our application is designed to simplify the holiday season and bring festive cheer to your workplace.
