## Abstract

Last year, our office faced challenges during our Christmas celebration, particularly with organizing our Secret Santa gift exchange. It became difficult to keep track of who was giving gifts to whom, leading to confusion and frustration among participants. To address this issue, a group of individuals within our office collaborated to create a dedicated website specifically designed to manage our Secret Santa event. The main goal was to simplify participation and ensure fairness for all employees involved.

The website features several key functionalities aimed at enhancing the Secret Santa experience. It provides an easy signup process, facilitates the management of the employee list, and generates unique codes for each person's Secret Santa assignment. This ensures clarity and transparency, making it effortless for everyone to identify their gift recipients.

Overall, the website was developed with the intention of making our office Christmas celebration more enjoyable and organized. It focuses on fostering inclusivity and excitement for the holiday season by providing a user-friendly platform for coordinating the Secret Santa exchange.

The abstract combines the narrative of the office's challenges during the previous Christmas celebration with the description of the developed website's features and objectives. It emphasizes the collaborative effort undertaken to address the issues faced and highlights the website's role in simplifying the Secret Santa event management process.
