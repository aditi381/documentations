## Abstract

Last year, our office faced challenges during our Christmas celebration, particularly with organizing our Secret Santa gift exchange. It became difficult to keep track of who was giving gifts to whom, leading to confusion and frustration among participants. To address this issue, a group of individuals within our office collaborated to create a dedicated website specifically designed to manage our Secret Santa event. The main goal was to simplify participation and ensure fairness for all employees involved.

The website features several key functionalities aimed at enhancing the Secret Santa experience. It provides an easy signup process, facilitates the management of the employee list, and generates unique codes for each person's Secret Santa assignment. This ensures clarity and transparency, making it effortless for everyone to identify their gift recipients.

Overall, the website was developed with the intention of making our office Christmas celebration more enjoyable and organized. It focuses on fostering inclusivity and excitement for the holiday season by providing a user-friendly platform for coordinating the Secret Santa exchange.

## Identifying the Need

We noticed some problems during our past office Christmas celebrations, especially with organizing our Secret Santa gift exchange. Doing it manually caused confusion and made it hard to keep things fair for everyone. People often got mixed up about who they were supposed to give gifts to, which wasn't much fun.

Rashmi Chaudhary Ma'am, saw these problems and realized we needed a better way to manage our Secret Santa event. She tasked the January intern with finding a solution to this issue, and everyone came up with their own ideas. Among them, Aman's idea was chosen, and this task was assigned to Aman, Aditi, and Irfan.
