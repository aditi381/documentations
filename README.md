## Abstract

The challenge of fostering transparency and engagement during the office Christmas celebration arose last year when participants encountered difficulty in determining their Secret Santa due to the anonymous distribution of chits containing names. In response, Rashmi Ma'am tasked the team with finding a solution. After considering various proposals, the decision was made to develop a dedicated website for managing Secret Santa exchanges. Under the guidance of Karandeep Sir, Aman, Aditi, and Irfan were entrusted with implementing this solution.

The website aims to streamline the Secret Santa experience by facilitating registration, assigning Secret Santas anonymously, and revealing assignments on a specified date to maintain surprise. Key features include ensuring the anonymity of assignments, enabling communication through anonymous messages, sending automated email reminders, and providing a platform for feedback.

Through technology-driven solutions, the objective is to enhance transparency, engagement, and holiday spirit among employees during the Secret Santa game. This approach seeks to address the challenges faced during the previous year's celebration and elevate the overall experience for participants.
